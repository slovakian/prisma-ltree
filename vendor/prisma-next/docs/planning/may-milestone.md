# May Milestone: Early Access (for users)

**Goal**: Users can pick up Prisma Next for Postgres, SQLite, or MongoDB and build a real application without hitting roadblocks. Validate this by porting real applications ourselves. Early feedback from users identifies feature gaps, finds bugs, tests the value proposition, and builds support for Prisma Postgres.

**Non-goals**:

- Upgrade path from Prisma 7
- Complete feature parity with Prisma 7
- Production-readiness certification
- A general "deployment recipes" story for every host (Workers is in scope because the MAP forces it; other hosts are not)

## What April delivered (and what carries over)

April was architectural validation. May builds on what landed and finishes the items that didn't reach their stop condition. Source-of-truth status:

- **WS1 Migration system** 🟡 — Manual migration authoring ✅, graph scales with large contracts ✅, data-migration graph + invariant-aware routing 🟡 (M4 ref-routing landed; full stop condition not yet met).
- **WS2 Contract authoring** ✅ — PSL/TS symmetric authoring (ADR 170), terseness, invisible emit: all stop conditions met.
- **WS3 Runtime pipeline** 🟡 — Transactions ✅, RSC concurrency ✅, extension ops 🟡 (real-contract regression coverage missing; TML-2163, TML-2299 open), caching middleware 🟡 (intercept plumbing landed; user story not end-to-end), streaming subscriptions 🔴 (unstarted), benchmarks side quest 🟡 (precondition met, suite not built). Detailed status: [april-ws3-status.md](./april-ws3-status.md).
- **WS4 MongoDB** ✅ — Contract extraction, ORM consolidation, polymorphism, schema migrations, data migrations, query builder — all stop conditions met.
- **WS5 SQLite** 🟡 — End-to-end vertical slice 🟡 (in progress), D1 extensibility check ✅.
- **WS6 Contributor readiness** 🔴 — Not started.

> Above uses April workstream numbering. May renumbers (see workstreams below): May WS5 = Contract authoring (greenfield), May WS6 = CLI/errors, May WS7 = Developer workflow commands.

This is meaningfully better than the worst-case assumption. April-WS2 (Contract authoring) and April-WS4 (MongoDB) are fully closed, freeing Alberto and Will/Serhii respectively. April-WS5 (SQLite) has more momentum than expected. **Implication for May staffing**: Alberto is now assigned to May WS5 (Contract authoring), and May WS6/WS7 remain queued. The actual carry-over weight (mostly in April-WS3 runtime) is lighter than feared. Reassess capacity allocation in the planning session — there may be room to lift one of WS6/WS7 out of the queue.

### April carry-overs that need explicit homes in May

| Item | Source | New home |
|---|---|---|
| TML-2143 — caching middleware end-to-end | WS3 VP4 | WS2 M0 (highest carry-over) |
| TML-2163 — shared operator-trait mapping | WS3 VP2 | WS2 M2 |
| TML-2299 — `sql.lateral` capability bug | WS3 VP2 | WS2 M2 |
| TML-2303 — RSC H2 marker-read dedupe | WS3 VP3 | WS2 M0 |
| TML-2218 — extension op nullability | WS3 backlog | WS2 M3 (design done) |
| TML-2197 — error consolidation | WS3 backlog | WS6 M1 |
| TML-2165, TML-2183 — benchmarks | WS3 side quest | Side quest under WS2 (parallel content track) |
| VP5 streaming subscriptions | WS3 VP5 | **Open question — explicit go/no-go required, see §Open questions** |

---

## Approach: user validation through representative apps

April proved the architecture. May proves the product. The primary forcing function is porting real applications to Prisma Next — each port exercises the full stack (authoring, emit, migrate, query, debug) and surfaces the gaps that unit tests and architectural PoCs miss.

The team has four people and 4–5 weeks. One person acts as a **full-stack scout** — porting real apps, defining the public API surface, and fixing gaps autonomously within tight bounds (see [Scout working method](#scout-working-method)). The remaining people work parallel workstreams addressing known gaps and incoming discoveries. Workstreams beyond the team size are queued and picked up as earlier ones complete or as people become available.

The full-stack scout is not a passive reporter. They have autonomy to address issues they find directly within the triage rule, collaborating with workstream owners to avoid conflicts when the fix touches workstream-owned territory. They are the closest thing to a real user the team has — their friction is the team's signal.

Building the apps is not the hard part. Addressing the limitations they uncover is. The apps are the discovery mechanism; the workstreams are where the real work happens.

### Scout working method

The scout's instinct under time pressure is to work around framework gaps. That instinct destroys the milestone's central forcing function — if the scout papers over gaps, nothing in WS2/WS3/WS5 changes, and EA ships with the same gaps. The working method is therefore:

1. **Log every gap.** Maintain a shared **gaps & findings log** as the discovery artifact. Every framework friction point — bug, missing feature, confusing error, weird workaround — is logged immediately, with concrete reproduction context.
2. **Don't paper over.** When the scout hits a real framework gap, the default is **stop and document**, not work-around-and-keep-moving.
3. **Triage rule.** The scout fixes a gap themselves only if **both** are true:
   - It is on the **critical path** of the port currently in progress.
   - It is **small** (rule of thumb: ≤ ~½ day of work).
   Otherwise, the gap is handed to the owning workstream.
4. **Daily standup is the triage venue.** Each morning, the team raises new findings, agrees priorities, and assigns gaps that aren't scout-fixable. Hand-offs happen there.
5. **The gaps log is the queue between scout and workstreams.** It's not a personal notebook. WS2/WS3/WS5 owners read it and pull from it.

This rule is what prevents the two failure modes: scout becomes a one-person framework engineer and never finishes a port; or scout drifts back to workarounds and the milestone forcing function dies silently.

## Cross-cutting: Cloudflare Workers as a first-party EA target

The MAP port (WS1 M1) runs on Cloudflare Workers, which forces PN to support Workers as a first-party EA target. This is grounded in real validation, not aspiration.

**Decisions made:**
- **First-party module**: a Workers-Postgres facade (Workers-shaped connection lifecycle, identical transport to ordinary Postgres) ships as part of `@prisma-next/postgres` (final placement TBD — module export, sibling package, or recipe). This is not throwaway scaffolding.
- **EA claim**: the EA story includes "PN runs on Cloudflare Workers" with the MAP as the validating workload.

**Implications per workstream (open decisions):**
- **WS1**: MAP runs on Workers. The Workers facade is a WS1 M0 deliverable.
- **WS2 M1 (transactions)**: does "transactions work on Postgres" cover Workers as a tested dimension, or is Workers-tx an explicit later commitment? Workers' connection lifecycle (no long-lived TCP, often fronted by transaction-mode poolers) makes Node-tx and Workers-tx two distinct claims. **Open.**
- **WS4 (test harness)**: does the harness add Workers as a fourth dimension, or is the MAP the sole Workers validation? **Open.**

**Out of scope**: a generic "PN deployment recipes for every host" story. PN already works with every standard pooler (PgBouncer, Hyperdrive, Supabase pooler, Neon pooler, RDS Proxy) out of the box; only Accelerate is incompatible (it accepts Prisma 7 query payloads, which PN doesn't speak). No general pooling workstream is required.

---

## Open questions (gating decisions before/early in May)

These items must be decided in the planning session or its immediate follow-ups; they affect scope, sequencing, and team allocation.

1. **VP5 streaming subscriptions go/no-go.** April left this entirely unstarted. Two options:
   - **In**: re-scope into May as a runtime-interface validation (Supabase adapter + `subscribe()` op + AbortSignal cleanup + one event through the plugin pipeline). Keeps the architectural door open before stabilising runtime/middleware/plugin interfaces for external contributors. Mongo workstream tracks change streams as `FL-14 → "Future (WS3 VP5)"` assuming this option.
   - **Out**: defer past May; accept potential breaking changes when streaming lands. Higher risk to the contributor-stability promise.
2. **Cal.com → Dub.co rationale.** Cal.com was originally chosen as "an external, large-scale Next.js application with a large Prisma 7 schema" — *those properties* made it a useful test of EA adoption. Confirm Dub.co still tests the same shape (or document what it tests instead). "More amenable to PN" is a yellow flag if it means "easier", not "still representative".
3. **WS2 M1 Workers-tx coverage.** See cross-cutting Workers section.
4. **WS4 Workers test dimension.** See cross-cutting Workers section.
5. **TML-2137 / TML-2138 disposition.** Extension ops in `aggregate` / `groupBy` / `having` — pull into WS2 M2 or defer past May.

---

## WS1: App porting + public API

**People**: 1 (the scout)

The scout. Ports real applications to Prisma Next, defines the public API surface (facade packages), maintains the gaps log, and fixes issues within the triage rule.

**Context**: Today, `@prisma-next/postgres` and `@prisma-next/sqlite` exist as facade packages with a single `./runtime` export. `@prisma-next/mongo` doesn't exist yet. The ~30 internal packages are not something we want to expose to users. The facade packages are the natural place to express the public API — what users import, what's stable, what's documented.

**Key risks**:

- The import surface is too complex or requires too many packages for a simple app.
- Real-world schemas expose ORM, query builder, or migration gaps that block adoption.
- The side-by-side story with Prisma 7 doesn't work in practice.
- The Workers facade is more invasive to land cleanly than expected, blocking the MAP port.

#### Milestone 0: Onboarding prerequisites

Before porting apps, verify the onboarding path works.

Tasks:

1. **`init` command** — scaffolding config, contract, and scripts for a new project. The first thing a new user runs. Implement or complete it.
2. **`@prisma-next/mongo` facade** — same structure as `@prisma-next/postgres` and `@prisma-next/sqlite`.
3. **Workers-Postgres facade as a first-party module** — Workers-shaped lifecycle, ordinary Postgres transport. Ship as part of `@prisma-next/postgres` (placement TBD: e.g. `@prisma-next/postgres/workers` export). Includes a recipe doc and at least a smoke-test against Miniflare/Wrangler.

Checkpoint: A new user can run `init`, get a working scaffold, and the scout can deploy `@prisma-next/postgres` on Cloudflare Workers without bespoke glue. `@prisma-next/mongo` is importable.

#### Milestone 1: Management API — reads

Port the Prisma Data Platform Management API's read endpoints to Prisma Next, running side by side with the existing Prisma 7 implementation. This is the gentlest forcing function — read queries against an existing database, no migrations, no writes.

**Note on connection layer**: the MAP currently routes through Accelerate, which PN can't speak (Prisma-7-protocol-specific). The port must replace Accelerate with a normal pooler (Hyperdrive, since the MAP runs on Workers). This is a port-local concern, not a general PN pooling story (see cross-cutting Workers section).

Tasks:

1. **Author the PDP contract in PSL** — model the Management API's schema in Prisma Next PSL, emit the contract, and verify the output is correct against the live database. Produce a PSL parity audit as a side-effect, classifying each gap encountered as `greenfield-blocker`, `defer-to-june`, or `worked-around-for-EA`. The audit is the input to WS5.
2. **Replace Accelerate with Workers-friendly pooling** — use the WS1 M0 Workers facade against Hyperdrive (or equivalent). Verify connectivity and pooling behaviour.
3. **Port read API endpoints** — replace Prisma 7 queries with Prisma Next ORM queries for all `get` and `list` operations. Use the SQL DSL as an escape hatch where the ORM can't express the query.
4. **Define the facade surface** — based on what you actually needed to import, define the public API for `@prisma-next/postgres`. Document what's exposed and what's internal.

Checkpoint: All `get` and `list` operations in the Management API use Prisma Next exclusively, running on Workers, without Accelerate. Prisma 7 is not used for any read operation. The `@prisma-next/postgres` facade surface is defined and documented.

#### Milestone 2: Management API — writes

Extend the port to include write operations and transactions.

Tasks:

1. **Port write endpoints** — replace Prisma 7 mutations with Prisma Next ORM mutations for all write operations (creates, updates, deletes).
2. **Transaction usage** — use transactions (built by WS2) in at least one multi-step business logic unit. Exercise ORM + SQL DSL interop within a transaction. **Note**: this is the first real test of transactions on Workers; coordinate with WS2 M1 on whether Workers-tx is in scope or a known carve-out.

Checkpoint: All write operations in the Management API use Prisma Next exclusively. At least one transactional workflow is ported and running on Workers (or the Workers-tx carve-out is documented). ORM and SQL DSL gaps discovered during the port are filed in the gaps log for WS2.

#### Milestone 3: PDP schema management via PN migrations

Port the PDP's database schema management from Prisma 7 migrations to Prisma Next migrations. This is the first real-world exercise of the migration workflow.

Tasks:

1. **Initial migration** — create the initial migration that represents the current PDP schema. Verify `migrate` produces the correct tables against a fresh database.
2. **Schema evolution** — make a schema change (add a model, add a field, add a relation), plan and apply the migration. Exercise the planner on common scenarios.
3. **Escape hatch** — hit a case the planner can't handle (or simulate one). Author a manual migration. Verify it integrates cleanly into the graph.
4. **Feedback to WS3** — file detailed UX feedback in the gaps log on every rough edge: confusing output, unclear errors, missing information, workflow friction.

Checkpoint: The PDP database schema is managed exclusively by Prisma Next migrations. At least one planned migration and one manual migration have been applied. Detailed migration UX feedback is in the gaps log for WS3.

#### Milestone 4: Dub.co adoption path

Validate that an external, open-source Next.js application can adopt Prisma Next. Dub.co replaces Cal.com as the external target — confirm the rationale in planning (see [Open questions](#open-questions-gating-decisions-beforeearly-in-may)).

Tasks:

1. **Contract authoring** — author a contract for Dub.co's schema (or a representative subset). Note any schema features that can't be expressed; greenfield-shaped gaps feed WS5, brownfield-shaped gaps (P7→PN syntax) feed the June milestone draft.
2. **Side-by-side setup** — configure PN alongside P7 in the Dub.co codebase. Verify the two can coexist without conflicts.
3. **Basic query port** — port a small number of queries to PN. Exercise both ORM and SQL DSL.
4. **Document the adoption path** — write up what worked, what didn't, and what a Dub.co developer would need to know. Hand off to DevRel.

Checkpoint: A written assessment of the Dub.co adoption path exists, with concrete evidence (working queries or documented blockers). A Dub.co developer could follow the documented path without our help. This is an evaluation, not a full port.

---

## WS2: Transactions + query surface

**People**: 1

The query surface is how users interact with their data. Transactions exist on Postgres only (April VP1). The SQL query builder is PoC-level. The ORM has gaps that will be discovered by WS1 and WS4. This workstream makes the query surface real and finishes the April runtime carry-overs.

**Key risks**:

- Transaction semantics are complex and interact with connection pooling, error handling, and the adapter abstraction. Mongo transactions and Workers transactions are each a separate claim from Postgres-on-Node.
- The SQL query builder needs to graduate from PoC to something users can rely on as an ORM escape hatch.
- ORM gaps may require structural changes, not just additive features.
- The MongoDB ORM may have feature parity gaps compared to the SQL ORM that surface during WS1 or WS4 — monitor and address if they arise.
- April carry-overs (caching middleware, op-trait mapping, sql.lateral, RSC H2) are critical-path commitments from prior contracts; under-scoping them risks shipping EA with known issues.

#### Milestone 0: April runtime carry-overs

Land the April work that didn't reach its stop condition. **Highest priority** — these are pre-existing commitments and the caching middleware is the proof point that PN's middleware interface supports the full short-circuit story.

Tasks:

1. **Caching middleware end-to-end** ([TML-2143](https://linear.app/prisma-company/issue/TML-2143)) — pull the `cache-middleware-intercept` / `cache-middleware-impl` branches over the line. Prove a repeated query is served from cache without hitting the database, against a real database.
2. **RSC H2 fix** ([TML-2303](https://linear.app/prisma-company/issue/TML-2303)) — dedupe in-flight contract verification (~10-line behaviour fix in `RuntimeCoreImpl.verifyPlanIfNeeded()`); tighten the existing PoC integration test from `markerReads ∈ [1, K]` to `markerReads === 1`.

Checkpoint: A repeated query is served from cache without DB roundtrip. The RSC marker-read storm is gone. Both have regression tests pinning the new behaviour.

#### Milestone 1: Transactions end-to-end

April validated that transactions are architecturally feasible on Postgres. May makes them work on every supported target.

Tasks:

1. **ORM transaction support** — `db.$transaction(async (tx) => { ... })` with commit on success, rollback on error. Already shipped on Postgres-on-Node; must extend to other targets/runtimes per below.
2. **SQL DSL within transactions** — the SQL DSL can execute queries within an ORM-opened transaction, sharing the same connection. (Already shipped on Postgres-on-Node.)
3. **Error handling** — errors inside a transaction trigger rollback and propagate to the caller with a clear error envelope (coordinate with WS6 M1).
4. **SQLite transactions** — extend ORM tx + SQL DSL interop to SQLite.
5. **MongoDB transactions** — extend to MongoDB where it supports transactions (replica sets / Atlas). Mongo's transaction semantics differ; treat as a separate claim from SQL.
6. **Workers transactions decision** — decide whether Workers-Postgres transactions are in scope for May or an explicit carve-out for June. (See [Open questions](#open-questions-gating-decisions-beforeearly-in-may).)

Checkpoint: A transaction opens, executes two ORM mutations and a SQL DSL query sharing the same connection, and commits, on Postgres-on-Node, SQLite, and MongoDB. An error inside a transaction triggers rollback and propagates cleanly. Workers-tx is either covered by an additional checkpoint or explicitly listed as a deferred claim.

#### Milestone 2: SQL query builder maturity

The SQL DSL is the escape hatch for the ORM. It needs to cover the queries that real applications need but the ORM can't express. This milestone also closes April's VP2 architectural debt.

Tasks:

1. **Audit against real-world query patterns** — review the Management API's queries (from WS1) and common SQL patterns. Identify what the builder can't express today.
2. **Implement missing query operations** — prioritized by what WS1 actually needs, then by common SQL patterns.
3. **Multi-target SQL generation** — verify that the builder produces correct SQL for both Postgres and SQLite (different quoting, function names, type handling).
4. **Shared operator-trait mapping** ([TML-2163](https://linear.app/prisma-company/issue/TML-2163)) — move the operator-to-trait mapping from `sql-orm-client` to `relational-core` so trait gating is consistent across both query surfaces. This is the April VP2 follow-up that was deliberately bounded by the stop condition.
5. **`sql.lateral` capability bug** ([TML-2299](https://linear.app/prisma-company/issue/TML-2299)) — `lateral` capability not emitted, making `lateralJoin` `never` on real contracts. Without this fix, the SQL DSL escape-hatch promise fails on real (non-fixture) contracts.

Checkpoint: The SQL DSL can express every query the Management API port (WS1) needs. Common patterns — joins, aggregations, subqueries, lateral joins — produce correct, parameterized SQL on both Postgres and SQLite. Trait gating works identically on ORM and SQL DSL surfaces. A real-contract regression test for trait-gated extension ops on the SQL DSL exists.

#### Milestone 3: ORM gap fixes

Address ORM gaps discovered by WS1 (app porting) and WS4 (test harness). The specific gaps are pulled from the gaps log; this is reactive work driven by incoming discoveries.

Tasks:

1. **Pull from the gaps log** — work the WS2-tagged gaps in priority order set at daily standup.
2. **Extension op nullability** ([TML-2218](https://linear.app/prisma-company/issue/TML-2218)) — design is complete in the ticket (Approach 2 — overloads — recommended). Implementation only. Unblocks ergonomic pgvector-style ops.

Checkpoint: No ORM gaps in the gaps log are blocking WS1's progress at end of milestone. The test harness (WS4) exercises ORM scenarios across all three targets without failures caused by ORM bugs. Extension op nullability ships.

#### Side quest: Comparative benchmarks

[TML-2165](https://linear.app/prisma-company/issue/TML-2165) and [TML-2183](https://linear.app/prisma-company/issue/TML-2183). Precondition (enough ORM/SQL DSL coverage to run a representative suite) is now met. High-visibility content piece — runs in parallel with the main WS2 milestones, owned alongside but not blocking the milestone path.

---

## WS3: Migrations maturity

**People**: 1

The migration system's architecture is validated (April VP1). The workflow is not. Nobody has used `migration plan → apply → status` to manage a real database. The planner covers limited scenarios. The escape hatch (manual migration authoring) is a PoC. CI/CD integration is untested. If the migration workflow isn't intuitive, it will destroy trust at EA — migrations are the highest-stakes developer workflow.

**Key risks**:

- The escape hatch is the critical path. The planner won't cover every scenario, and users will need to author migrations by hand. If this feels clunky, the entire migration system fails regardless of how good the planner is.
- Predictability is trust. Users must be able to trivially answer "what migrations will run when I push this." Any surprises will erode confidence instantly.
- Preflight verification may be necessary. Prisma 7's shadow database catches migration errors before they hit production. We need an equivalent confidence mechanism.

#### Milestone 1: Escape hatch UX

The planner can't cover every schema change. When it can't, the user authors a migration manually. This must feel natural — not like an emergency procedure.

Tasks:

1. **Refine the scaffold command** — the scaffold command (currently `migration new` or equivalent) produces a migration file with the correct graph coordinates pre-populated. The user writes their logic and it just works.
2. **Manual migration for common unsupported cases** — test against the cases the planner can't handle today. The manual path must cover them seamlessly.
3. **Graph integration** — manual migrations are indistinguishable from planner-generated migrations in the graph. `plan`, `apply`, `status` treat them identically.

Checkpoint: A developer scaffolds a manual migration for a case the planner doesn't support, writes the migration logic, and applies it. The manual migration is a first-class graph node — `plan`, `apply`, and `status` treat it identically to planner-generated migrations. The workflow feels natural, not like an escape hatch.

#### Milestone 2: Workflow UX + predictability

The full migration loop — change schema, plan, review, apply, verify — must produce clear, helpful output at every step. The user must always know what will happen next.

Tasks:

1. **`migration plan` output** — clear, human-readable summary of planned operations. The user can review and approve before applying.
2. **`migration status` output** — unambiguous answer to "where am I?" and "what will run next?" relative to the migration graph.
3. **`migrate` output** — progress indication, success confirmation, and clear error messages on failure.
4. **Error diagnostics** — every migration error tells the user what went wrong and suggests a next step. No stack traces without context.
5. **`db verify` / `db sign` guidance** — ensure the workflow for verifying contracts against live databases and signing them for production is documented and produces clear output. These commands exist but their place in the user workflow needs to be made obvious.

Checkpoint: A developer runs the full migration loop (plan → review → apply → verify) and always understands what's happening. "What migrations will run when I push this to production?" is trivially answerable from the CLI output.

#### Milestone 3: Migration preflight

Users need confidence that a migration will succeed before running it against production. Prisma 7's shadow database provides this. We need an equivalent mechanism.

Tasks:

1. **Design the preflight mechanism** — decide on the approach (shadow database, dry-run mode, test database verification, or something simpler). The mechanism must work in both local development and CI.
2. **Implement preflight** — a command or flag that verifies migrations will apply cleanly without modifying the target database.
3. **CI integration** — preflight can run as a CI check that gates deployment.

Checkpoint: A developer verifies that pending migrations will apply cleanly before deploying to production. The mechanism works locally and in CI. Migration failures are caught before they reach production.

#### Milestone 4: Planner coverage expansion

Once the workflow is solid, broaden the automatic planner to cover common migration scenarios — targeting at least Prisma 7 parity for typical cases.

Tasks:

1. **Audit P7 planner coverage** — identify the schema changes P7 handles automatically.
2. **Implement common cases** — add planner strategies for each common case, prioritized by frequency.
3. **Multi-target** — planner produces correct DDL for Postgres, SQLite, and MongoDB.

Checkpoint: The planner handles the common 80% of schema changes that Prisma 7 handles — add model, drop model, add field, drop field, rename field, add relation, change field type. Uncommon cases fall through to the escape hatch gracefully.

---

## WS4: Multi-target test harness

**People**: 1

Confidence in correctness across Postgres, SQLite, and MongoDB. Today's tests are per-target and ad hoc. A shared test suite exercising the same scenarios across all three targets catches family-specific bugs, ensures behavioural consistency, and prevents regressions.

**Key risks**:

- Behavioural differences between targets may be larger than expected (e.g. type coercion, NULL handling, transaction semantics).
- The test harness infrastructure itself is non-trivial — parameterizing tests across three different databases with different setup/teardown requirements.
- Workers-as-a-test-dimension is unresolved. If the harness doesn't pick it up, the MAP port becomes the sole validation of Workers support — fine if intended, fragile if accidental.

#### Milestone 1: Shared test suite infrastructure

Tasks:

1. **Test harness design** — parameterized test runner that takes a target configuration (connection, adapter, contract) and runs the same test suite against each target.
2. **Database lifecycle** — automated setup, migration, seeding, and teardown for each target's test database.
3. **Target configurations** — working configurations for Postgres, SQLite, and MongoDB.
4. **Workers dimension decision** — decide whether the harness adds a Workers (Miniflare) target, or whether the MAP port is the sole Workers validation.

Checkpoint: A single test file runs the same scenario against Postgres, SQLite, and MongoDB. Each target uses its own database instance and adapter. Failures are clearly attributed to a specific target. Database setup and teardown are fully automated. The Workers dimension decision is documented.

#### Milestone 2: ORM scenario coverage

Exercise the ORM through representative scenarios across all three targets.

Tasks:

1. **CRUD operations** — create, read, update, delete across all targets.
2. **Relations and includes** — relation traversal, eager loading, nested queries.
3. **Filtering and ordering** — where clauses, sorting, pagination.
4. **Aggregations** — count, sum, avg, min, max, group by.
5. **Edge cases** — NULL handling, empty results, type coercion, large result sets.

Checkpoint: A comprehensive ORM scenario suite runs green on all three targets. Any failures are filed in the gaps log for WS2 with clear target attribution.

#### Milestone 3: Migration scenario coverage

Exercise the migration workflow across targets.

Tasks:

1. **Plan and apply common schema changes** — add model, add field, add relation, drop model, rename field.
2. **Manual migrations** — scaffold and apply a manual migration on each target.
3. **Data migrations** — run a data migration on each target.

Checkpoint: `migration plan`, `migrate`, and `migration status` work correctly on Postgres, SQLite, and MongoDB for common schema change scenarios. Manual and data migrations integrate into the graph on all targets.

## WS5: Contract authoring for greenfield

**People**: Alberto

PSL is the primary authoring surface for the EA audience, but the April workstream was explicitly **Contract authoring (PSL + TypeScript)**. A greenfield user picking up Prisma Next will write a `schema.prisma` for their domain — orgs, users, memberships, posts, tags, audit columns — and expect the language to handle the patterns they already know from any modern ORM. A TS-first user should be able to point config at `contract.ts`, have tooling inspect it deterministically, and get the same canonical contract artifacts as the PSL path.

**Scope is greenfield only.** This workstream does not own P7→PN upgrade syntax (`@ignore`, `@@schema`, implicit many-to-many, views, `Unsupported(...)` round-trip) — those are June concerns once the EA story is real. The acceptance test is "a typical SaaS skeleton authors cleanly in PSL without workarounds, while the equivalent TS contract can be inspected and emitted through the same config-driven tooling."

**Key risks**:

- Some gaps (native scalar arrays, composite PKs) require contract-IR and codec changes that ripple through emit, migrate, and ORM, not just the PSL layer. The work is wider than its name suggests.
- The list of "common greenfield patterns" can grow without bound. Without a tight bound, this workstream becomes "make PSL match Prisma 7" — exactly the June work we're deferring.
- Some changes (inline `@db.X`) interact with the printer's named-type strategy and risk producing inconsistent contracts on a `infer → edit → emit` round-trip.
- TypeScript contracts must remain deterministic and inspectable by tooling. If the TS path silently imports app code or diverges from the PSL canonicalization path, TS-first becomes a second product instead of a second authoring surface.
- Language-server support is a trust issue. If the emitter accepts Prisma Next PSL but the editor marks it invalid, users will assume the product is broken.

#### Milestone 1: Greenfield gap inventory (gate)

The scout (WS1 M1) authors the Management API contract and produces the parity audit. This workstream picks up the `greenfield-blocker` set, prioritizes it against representative greenfield schemas, and cuts the list to what fits the available capacity.

Tasks:

1. **Reconcile the audit with greenfield exemplars** — cross-reference scout findings with at least two reference schemas: a SaaS skeleton (orgs, users, memberships, posts, tags, audit timestamps) and one public starter (e.g. T3-shaped Next.js app).
2. **Classify and cut** — confirm each item is greenfield-shaped and not P7-upgrade-shaped. Items that don't fit get explicitly listed in the June milestone doc rather than implicitly deferred.
3. **Port April contract-authoring carry-over** — pull the unfinished April items from [april-ws3-status.md § Contract authoring](./april-ws3-status.md#contract-authoring-psl--typescript--april-carry-over): language-server update, ADR 170 helper/preset polish, closed PSL grammar policy, language-server rewrite spike, and TypeScript contract introspection.
4. **Document the in-scope set** — produce a short, ticket-backed plan covering at most two weeks of one engineer.

Checkpoint: A scoped, prioritized backlog of greenfield-blocker contract-authoring gaps exists. Items deferred to June are explicitly captured in the June milestone draft, and the April carry-over items have a named May home or a written no-go.

#### Milestone 2: High-frequency authoring fixes

The non-negotiables for greenfield SaaS authoring. Each of these is something a competent backend engineer expects to "just work" on day one.

Tasks:

1. **Native scalar arrays** — `String[]`, `Int[]`, etc. lower to native Postgres arrays (`text[]`, `int4[]`) with their own codecs, not JSON. Mongo arrays already work natively. (TML-1909.)
2. **Composite primary keys (`@@id`)** — accept `@@id([col1, col2])` in the interpreter. Closes the printer↔interpreter asymmetry that breaks `contract infer` round-trip on any junction table.
3. **`@updatedAt`** — register as a built-in execution default that updates on every mutation. Wire through both SQL and Mongo ORM mutation paths.
4. **Inline `@db.X`** — accept native-type attributes directly on model fields (`email String @db.VarChar(255)`), or — if the named-type architecture makes that disruptive — emit an actionable diagnostic that produces a one-step fix-it suggestion pointing to the `types {}` alias.

Checkpoint: A SaaS skeleton schema (orgs, users, memberships with composite PK, posts with `tags String[]`, audit `createdAt`/`updatedAt` columns, `@db.Text` descriptions, `@db.VarChar` slugs) authors cleanly in PSL, emits a working contract, migrates onto a fresh Postgres database without manual edits, and round-trips through `contract infer` back to an equivalent PSL source. Equivalent TS-authoring fixtures that touch the same contract-IR changes continue to emit the same canonical contract.

#### Milestone 3: Shared helper vocabulary + TS contract introspection

April stopped after proving that symmetric PSL/TS authoring is possible. May needs the less glamorous part: finishing the helper vocabulary, making presets feel intentional, and making `.ts` contracts inspectable by config-driven tooling instead of only by app code.

Tasks:

1. **ADR 170 helper/preset coverage** — finish the family-provided constructors, target-native constructors, extension namespaced constructors, and common field presets needed by the greenfield skeleton and WS1 app-port schemas. Both PSL and TS lower through the same definitions.
2. **TypeScript contract introspection** — make `contract: './prisma/contract.ts'` a first-class tooling input: config/facade provider selection, deterministic source-contract inspection under ADR 096/100 constraints, canonical JSON emission, and `contract.d.ts` generation.
3. **PSL/TS parity fixtures** — keep representative PSL and TS contracts side-by-side and assert identical canonical JSON/coreHash when they express the same schema, including one family helper and one extension helper.
4. **Diagnostic quality on rejected constructs** — every `PSL_UNSUPPORTED_*` diagnostic carries an explicit hint: what's not supported, why, and the recommended workaround (or "deferred to June, see <link>").
5. **Test-backed parity inventory** — replace ad-hoc product docs with a parity matrix derived from the diagnostic registry plus integration test fixtures, so it can't drift unnoticed. Owner can be DevRel later, but the source of truth is the codebase.

Checkpoint: A first-time user opens the docs, sees the supported authoring surface and known limitations, authors a contract, and recovers gracefully from any limitation diagnostic. A TS-first user can point config at `contract.ts`, emit canonical artifacts, and get the same `coreHash` as the equivalent PSL fixture.

#### Milestone 4: Language-server support

The editor must agree with the emitter. This milestone ships the mechanical language-server update from April and turns the Rust-dependency rewrite into a deliberate decision instead of a vague deferred item.

Tasks:

1. **Load Prisma Next config** — the VS Code extension's language server finds and loads `prisma-next.config.ts`, resolving the selected target and extension packs.
2. **Use composed authoring contributions** — diagnostics and completions are derived from the same helper/preset registry used by emit, so ADR 170 constructors and field presets don't require language-server-specific hardcoding.
3. **Closed grammar diagnostics** — unsupported extension grammar forms produce an explicit diagnostic explaining that extensions contribute through existing syntax and ADR 170 helpers, not parser plugins.
4. **Rewrite go/no-go** — decide whether the language server must be rewritten away from the Rust dependency for EA. The default path is to ship the mechanical update; the rewrite proceeds only if the current dependency blocks Prisma Next semantics in a concrete way.

Checkpoint: A representative Prisma Next PSL schema that uses a family helper, a target-native helper, and an extension namespaced helper emits successfully and opens in VS Code without false red squiggles. The language-server rewrite has a written go/no-go with the reason.

## WS6: CLI + error consistency

**People**: queued (picked up when an earlier workstream completes)

The CLI is the primary interface for authoring, migration, and database management workflows. Consistent output formats, error messages, and return types across all commands build confidence. Inconsistency erodes it.

**Key risks**:

- Error messages today may be stack traces or raw exceptions rather than user-facing diagnostics.
- Different commands may use different output formats, making the CLI feel like a collection of scripts rather than a cohesive tool.
- Five inconsistent error sites today, none matching ADR 027 ([TML-2197](https://linear.app/prisma-company/issue/TML-2197)) — this is the prerequisite for opening the framework to external contributors per ADR 027.

#### Milestone 1: Error envelope consistency

All CLI commands and runtime operations return errors in a consistent format with a stable error code, a human-readable message, and a suggested next step. This includes both CLI error output and runtime error envelopes returned by the query engine and adapters.

Tasks:

1. **Audit existing error paths** — catalog every CLI command and runtime operation's error output, including query engine and adapter errors. Identify inconsistencies.
2. **Define the error envelope** — stable error codes, human-readable messages, suggested remediation. Consistent across CLI and runtime (query errors, connection errors, constraint violations).
3. **Consolidate `RuntimeError` creation** ([TML-2197](https://linear.app/prisma-company/issue/TML-2197)) — collapse the five inconsistent error sites into a canonical foundation package, aligned with ADR 027. Prerequisite for external-contributor framework stability.
4. **Implement consistently** — update all commands and runtime error paths to use the standard envelope.

Checkpoint: All CLI commands and runtime operations produce errors in a consistent envelope: stable error code, human-readable message, suggested next step. No raw stack traces appear in user-facing output. Runtime query and adapter errors use the same envelope structure. `RuntimeError` is consolidated per ADR 027.

#### Milestone 2: CLI output consistency

All CLI commands use consistent formatting, progress indication, and output modes (human-readable default, machine-readable via flag).

Tasks:

1. **Output audit** — catalog formatting across all commands, including undocumented or orphan commands (e.g. `inspect-live-schema`, `contract-infer-paths`). Clean up or remove commands that don't belong in the public CLI.
2. **Standardize** — consistent headers, progress indicators, success/failure formatting.
3. **Machine-readable mode** — all commands support a `--json` (or equivalent) flag for programmatic consumption.

Checkpoint: All CLI commands share a consistent visual language — formatting, progress indication, success/failure presentation. Every command supports a machine-readable output mode.

#### Milestone 3: CI/CD integration

Migrations are a critical component of deployment pipelines. The CLI must work in automated environments without interactive prompts, with correct exit codes and machine-readable output.

Tasks:

1. **Non-interactive mode** — all migration commands work without interactive prompts in CI.
2. **Exit codes** — correct exit codes for success, failure, nothing-to-do, and error conditions.
3. **Machine-readable output** — JSON or structured output mode for CI tooling to parse.
4. **Pipeline testing** — exercise the full CI/CD flow: plan in CI, apply in CD, status as a gate.

Checkpoint: A CI/CD pipeline runs migration plan, preflight, and apply using the PN CLI. Exit codes are correct for automation. Machine-readable output is available for tooling. No interactive prompts block automated execution.

## WS7: Developer workflow commands

**People**: queued (picked up when an earlier workstream completes)

Not everyone uses migrations, especially during early development. `db update` ("just make my dev database match my schema") and `db init` ("set up a fresh database") are the non-migration workflow for day-to-day development. These commands are how greenfield developers get started and iterate quickly — they need to work reliably across all targets.

`contract infer` (introspect an existing database into a contract) already ships for SQL targets. Its greenfield round-trip parity (the patterns WS5 makes authorable must also be inferable cleanly so `db init → contract infer` produces an equivalent contract) is owned by WS5 as part of printer↔interpreter symmetry. Brownfield-specific pattern coverage (e.g. `@ignore` for unrepresentable columns, `@@schema`, implicit many-to-many inference, views, `Unsupported(...)` placeholders) is deferred to June.

**Key risks**:

- `db update` may fail on schema changes that the migration planner handles, confusing users about which tool to use when.
- `db init` correctness is critical: a wrong fresh-database setup destroys trust before the user runs a single query.

#### Milestone 1: `db update` and `db init` reliability

`db update` is the fast iteration tool for development. `db init` sets up a fresh database from a contract. Both must work reliably across all targets.

Tasks:

1. **`db update` coverage** — ensure `db update` handles common development-cycle schema changes (add field, add model, change type) cleanly.
2. **`db init` correctness** — verify `db init` creates a correct database from a contract on Postgres, SQLite, and MongoDB.
3. **Clear guidance on `db update` vs migrations** — when `db update` can't handle a change, the error should guide the user to use migrations instead.

Checkpoint: `db update` handles common development-cycle schema changes without errors on all three targets. `db init` creates a correct database on Postgres, SQLite, and MongoDB. When `db update` hits a case it can't handle, the error message directs the user to use migrations.

# ADR 020 — Result Typing and Projection Inference Rules

## Context

- Users and agents rely on predictable TypeScript result types from the SQL DSL and the optional ORM layer
- Inference must be stable across lanes, dialects, and adapter updates to keep DX, CI snapshots, and agent prompts trustworthy
- Ambiguity usually stems from joins, aggregates, and adapter-specific lowerings for nested results

## Decision

- All result types are `AsyncIterable<T>` where `T` is inferred from the query projection (per ADR 037)
- Standardize how the SQL DSL and ORM compute element type `T` from projections and joins
- Define nullability propagation rules for LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, and common aggregates
- Push dialect-specific edge cases behind adapter capabilities so the type rules remain stable while allowing adapters to refine details

## Scope

### In scope

- SELECT results for SQL DSL and ORM-lowered single-statement queries
- Projections, joins, simple expressions, and common aggregates
- Nested results produced by core traversal nodes (`nestArray`, `joinFlat`) lowered by adapters using single-statement strategies

### Out of scope

- Multi-statement orchestration and unit-of-work semantics
- Driver-specific runtime result decoding beyond codecs already configured

## Sources of type information

**Order of precedence:**
1. Projection alias types when explicitly annotated in the builder API or via codecs
2. Column types from the data contract for fields accessed via the `(f, fns) => ...` callback proxy
3. Expression typing rules defined below
4. Adapter refinements where the adapter declares more precise behaviors via capabilities

If multiple sources disagree, the more specific one wins and the less specific is widened.

## Projection rules

- `db.user.select('alias', (f) => f.id)` yields `{ alias: number }` based on contract column type
- `db.user.select('alias', (_f, fns) => fns.count())` yields `{ alias: number }`
- `db.order.select('alias', (f, fns) => fns.sum(f.amount))` yields the aggregate result type per the aggregate rules below
- Duplicate aliases are a compile-time error in strict mode and produce a warning in permissive mode
- `SELECT *` is allowed by the core but strongly discouraged and typically linted as error
  - When used, the result is the intersection of all visible table fields with join-based nullability applied, breaking ties by last-projected table in deterministic order

### Nested projection metadata

- `meta.projection` may include nested descriptors to reflect structured outputs from `nestArray` and dotted paths for `joinFlat` aliases
- `meta.refs` remains a flat list of referenced tables/columns and includes nested/junction references for guardrails

## Join nullability rules

Given `FROM A` and a selected field sourced from table `T`:

- **INNER JOIN T**: leaves nullability unchanged
  - `A.col` as in contract, `T.col` as in contract
- **LEFT JOIN T**: makes all `T.*` nullable
  - `T.col` becomes `Nullable<ColType>` regardless of original nullability
  - `A.*` unchanged
- **RIGHT JOIN T**: makes all `A.*` nullable and leaves `T.*` unchanged
  - Not all adapters implement RIGHT JOIN; if adapter lowers to LEFT JOIN by swapping sides, the same rule applies relative to the rewritten sides
- **FULL OUTER JOIN**: makes both `A.*` and `T.*` nullable
- **Self-joins**: follow the same rules per logical side, disambiguated by table alias
- **CROSS JOIN**: leaves nullability unchanged for both sides

### Notes

- Nullability from JOIN combines with column-level nullability via union:
  - A nullable column on the preserved side remains nullable
  - A non-nullable column on the non-preserved side becomes nullable
- Adapter profiles can refine nullability only when they provably enforce filtering that restores inner semantics
  - Such refinements must be covered by golden tests

## Expression typing rules

- **Boolean predicates** like `eq`, `gt`, `lt`, `in` type to `boolean` for projection purposes
  - Three-valued SQL logic is not encoded in result types; in WHERE, unknown behaves as false
- **CASE WHEN** unions branch types and propagates nullability if any branch can be null
  - `CASE WHEN cond THEN number ELSE NULL END` yields `number | null`
- **COALESCE(a, b, ...)** yields the first non-nullable type in order or the union of all types if none is non-nullable
- **Arithmetic on numerics** promotes to the widest participating numeric type declared by the contract
  - Mixing `int4` and `float8` yields `number`
- **String concatenation** yields `string`
- **JSON construction functions** yield `unknown` by default and `T` when paired with an explicit codec or typed builder helper

## Aggregate typing rules

Assume no FILTER and no DISTINCT unless specified:

- **COUNT(*)** yields `number` and is non-null
- **COUNT(expr)** yields `number` and is non-null
- **SUM(int*)** yields `number | null`
  - null when the group contains zero rows or all expr are null
- **SUM(float*)** yields `number | null` with the same semantics
- **AVG(*)** yields `number | null`
- **MIN(expr)** and **MAX(expr)** yield `T | null` where `T` is the expression type
- **ARRAY_AGG(T)** yields `T[] | null` by default
  - Adapters may flip to `T[]` if they guarantee `COALESCE(array_agg(...), '{}')` and must advertise `arrayAggCoalescesEmpty` capability
- **JSON_AGG(T)** yields `unknown[] | null` by default
  - With a typed child projection and `jsonAggTypedChildren` capability, adapters may refine to `ChildRow[] | null`
  - Adapters may coalesce to `ChildRow[]` if they lower with `COALESCE(json_agg(...), '[]'::json)` and declare `jsonAggCoalescesEmpty`
- **includeMany**: The SQL DSL's `includeMany` feature uses `json_agg` to return nested arrays. The runtime converts `NULL` json_agg results to empty arrays `[]` for consistency, ensuring the result type is always `Array<ChildShape>` rather than `Array<ChildShape> | null`. Include aliases are marked in plan meta with `include:alias` to enable special JSON array decoding. The builder tracks includes at the type level, maintaining a map of include aliases to their child projection types, allowing `InferNestedProjectionRow` to infer `Array<ChildShape>` instead of `Array<unknown>`.

### Grouping

- With GROUP BY, any projected non-aggregate field must appear in the grouping set or compilation fails
- Result nullability from aggregates ignores join preservation because aggregates collapse the group
- Join-induced nullability only matters for inputs to aggregates, not the aggregate's own nullability except as defined above

## Relationship traversal typing rules

For core traversal nodes lowered by adapters:

- **nestArray (1:N and M:N)**
  - Yields `{ alias: ChildRow[] | null }` by default
  - If the adapter declares `jsonAggCoalescesEmpty` (or equivalent), and the node sets `coalesceEmpty`, yields `{ alias: ChildRow[] }`
  - Child `where`, `orderBy`, and `limit` do not affect parent row nullability

- **joinFlat (N:1)**
  - With `required: false` (LEFT JOIN semantics), projected child fields are `T | null`
  - With `required: true` (INNER JOIN semantics), projected child fields are `T`

## Aliasing and collisions

- Projection alias names must be unique within a query
- When selecting the same column under multiple aliases, each alias gets its own type copy
- Table aliasing does not affect the result field name unless explicitly used as the projection alias

## Adapter refinements

Adapters can narrow types only when they guarantee a specific lowering behavior:
- Coalesced aggregates may drop `| null`
- Known scalar function result widths may be refined to narrower branded types via codecs
- Explicit capabilities must be documented and covered by golden tests

## Examples

### Left join nullability

```typescript
// user INNER JOIN post
db.user
  .innerJoin(db.post, (f, fns) => fns.eq(f.user.id, f.post.user_id))
  .select((f) => ({ uid: f.user.id, pid: f.post.id }))
// { uid: number, pid: number }

// user LEFT JOIN post
db.user
  .outerLeftJoin(db.post, (f, fns) => fns.eq(f.user.id, f.post.user_id))
  .select((f) => ({ uid: f.user.id, pid: f.post.id }))
// { uid: number, pid: number | null }
```

### Aggregates

```typescript
// Count is never null
db.order.select('c', (_f, fns) => fns.count())
// { c: number }

// Sum may be null when no rows
db.order.select('s', (f, fns) => fns.sum(f.amount))
// { s: number | null }
```

### ORM 1:N nested via json_agg

```typescript
// With adapter not coalescing
// { id: number, posts: Array<{ id: number, title: string }> | null }

// With adapter coalescing
// { id: number, posts: Array<{ id: number, title: string }> }
```

### SQL DSL includeMany

```typescript
// SQL DSL includeMany always returns Array (runtime converts NULL to [])
// Type inference tracks includes at the type level to infer ChildShape
// { id: number, posts: Array<{ id: number, title: string }> }
```

## Testing

- Golden typing tests mapping representative projections and joins to expected TS types
- Adapter conformance tests asserting capability-driven refinements do not widen types unexpectedly
- Cross-lane equivalence tests ensuring ORM-lowered plans produce the same result types as hand-written DSL with equivalent SQL
- Regression tests for LEFT/RIGHT/FULL join nullability and aggregate nullability

## Backwards compatibility and evolution

- These rules define typing v1 for result inference
- Adapters may add refinements behind explicit capabilities without breaking v1
- Any change that widens a type must be considered breaking at the typing level and coordinated with a major adapter version bump or a new typing profile

## Rationale

- Users and agents need a small set of stable rules to predict shapes without reading adapter internals
- Join and aggregate nullability are the primary sources of confusion; codifying them reduces surprises
- Keeping refinements behind capabilities preserves a thin core while allowing high-fidelity adapters to improve precision

## Open questions

- Whether to surface a user-level option to always coalesce collection aggregates for ergonomics, trading some SQL strictness for simpler types
- Strategy for typing window functions beyond `row_number()` and `rank()` defaults
- Standard branded numeric types for COUNT, SUM, and AVG to help downstream budget rules

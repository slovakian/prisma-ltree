Prints Prisma Schema Language (PSL) from `PslDocumentAst` (`@prisma-next/framework-components/psl-ast`).

## Overview

`@prisma-next/psl-printer` renders deterministic PSL text from a `PslDocumentAst` (defined in `@prisma-next/framework-components/psl-ast`). The package is target-agnostic: SQL → AST construction lives in the SQL family (`@prisma-next/family-sql`'s `inferPslContract` capability).

## Responsibilities

- Convert structured AST (`model`, `field`, `enum`, `types`) into valid PSL output.
- Preserve `@map` / `@@map` and relation attributes from AST nodes.
- Generate deterministic output so snapshot-based tests remain stable.

## Dependencies

- **Depends on**
  - `@prisma-next/framework-components`
- **Used by**
  - `@prisma-next/cli` (consumes `printPsl(ast)` after the SQL family produces the AST)
  - `@prisma-next/family-sql` (tests; consumes the printer to verify AST construction)

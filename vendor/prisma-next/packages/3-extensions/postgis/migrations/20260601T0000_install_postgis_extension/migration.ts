/**
 * postgis baseline migration — install the `postgis` Postgres extension
 * and register the invariantId for `geometry(SRID)` columns downstream
 * consumers depend on.
 *
 * The contract IR (see `<package>/src/contract.json`) declares only the
 * parameterised native type `geometry` under `storage.types` — postgis
 * ships no tables of its own. The single op here carries the
 * `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis` DDL plus a postcondition
 * that confirms the extension landed; downstream user columns naming
 * `geometry` as `nativeType` rely on this op having applied first.
 *
 * The op carries the stable `postgis:install-postgis-v1` invariantId —
 * once published it is immutable.
 *
 * Authoring loop: this file is hand-edited. The CLI's `migration plan`
 * command refuses to scaffold this directory because postgis's
 * contract has no tables / models for the planner to diff (only a
 * `storage.types` registration, which the planner doesn't translate
 * into a DDL op). The migration directory + Migration subclass + a
 * seed `migration.json` were authored by hand; `node migration.ts`
 * then re-emits `ops.json` + `migration.json` deterministically.

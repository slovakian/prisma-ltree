## Decision

A schema diff is computed between two schema IRs of the same shape — an *expected* IR and an *actual* IR. Both are produced by **derivation**: the expected IR from a contract, the actual IR by introspecting a live database. The differ compares the two IRs and reads nothing else — no contract, no database catalog — so it does not depend on which source produced either side.

The differ **walks the two IRs as a tree.** It is given two corresponding nodes — at the top, the two database roots — compares them, and descends into their children, recording a difference wherever the two sides disagree. Because it takes a single node on each side (not a list), it diffs any two corresponding subtrees alike: two databases, or — below them — two tables. Every node answers three methods:

```ts
interface DiffableNode {
  id(): string;                              // a single path segment
  nodeKind(): string;                        // per-node discriminant; never folded into id()
  isEqualTo(other: DiffableNode): boolean;   // compares a matched pair
  children(): readonly DiffableNode[];       // the node's children; empty for a leaf
}
```

The differ accumulates ids into a **path** as it descends. Starting at `diffSchemas(expected, actual)` with an empty parent path, each call to `diffPair` prepends the node's `id()` and passes the extended path to `diffChildren`. Every emitted issue carries the full path from the root:

```ts
const issues: readonly SchemaDiffIssue[] = diffSchemas(expected, actual);
// SchemaDiffIssue = { path: readonly string[], outcome, expected?, actual? }
//   outcome: 'missing' | 'extra' | 'mismatch'
```

The differ pairs siblings by the combination of `nodeKind()` and `id()`, not by `id()` alone: `id()` needs only be unique among siblings of the same `nodeKind()` at a level, not unique across the whole level (enforced by a duplicate throw on a genuine same-kind/same-id collision). Two distinct kinds of child in the same slot list — say a role and a namespace — may legitimately share a name; they are never paired against each other, so the shared name is harmless. A node never encodes its kind into its `id()` string to route around a collision; `nodeKind()` is the discriminant that does that job.

Not every node is an entity with a contract-level coordinate. A column has no `EntityCoordinate`; its identity within the differ is its path. The differ is agnostic to entity coordinates entirely; it operates only on ids and paths.

The differ is **total**: an unmatched node emits its own issue and descends, emitting an issue for every node in the missing or extra subtree. Coalescing a parent change over its children is the planner's responsibility. Ownership filtering — dropping `extra` issues in namespaces a contract doesn't own — is the caller's responsibility, not the differ's.

It emits a `mismatch` when a matched pair is not `isEqualTo`, pairs their children by `(nodeKind(), id())`, recurses into each matched child, and emits one issue per disagreement.

The top node of each IR is the **database** — a real node in the topology, since you connect to and migrate one database, not a synthetic wrapper fabricated to satisfy the differ. Its `id()` is the database/schema name; its `isEqualTo` is trivially true until there are database-level attributes worth diffing; its `children()` are the database's entities. (Roles are cluster-scoped — above any one database — so when they enter the diff they will attach to a cluster node above the database root, or to the database root pragmatically; that is settled when roles are diffed, not here.)

- **missing** — in expected, not in actual.
- **extra** — in actual, not in expected.
- **mismatch** — the two pair by `(nodeKind(), id())`, but `isEqualTo` is false.

For instance, an RLS policy present in the expected IR but absent from the database produces one `missing` issue at that policy's path, which the planner turns into a `CREATE POLICY`. The path records exactly where in the schema tree the issue sits.

The differ is generic: it calls only those methods, so its code never names a policy, a role, or a table. Each node supplies its own `id` / `nodeKind` / `isEqualTo` / `children` from the package that defines it.

## The two sides are derived IRs of one shape

A *derivation* turns a source into a schema IR. There are two of them:

- **project-from-contract** reads a contract into a schema IR.
- **project-from-database** introspects a live database into a schema IR.

They are peers and emit the same IR shape. A command wires one derivation to each side of the diff:

| Command | expected | actual |
| --- | --- | --- |
| apply a contract to a database | contract | database |
| verify a database against a contract | contract | database |
| generate a migration with no database in reach | contract | contract |

Because both sides are one shape no matter which derivation built them, a single comparison serves every command, and the planner that consumes the diff reads outcomes without asking where either side came from. A side's provenance lives in the command's choice of derivation — not in the differ, and not in the planner.

One guarantee falls out of this and the differ relies on it: a node is only ever paired against a node of its own type. Both derivations build the IR in the same shape, so two nodes that share an id are the same type, and `isEqualTo` can compare them as such.

## The schema IR's tree structure determines the order of migration operations

The diff feeds the **planner** — the stage that turns a set of differences into the ordered list of operations a migration runs: the `CREATE POLICY` / `DROP` / `ALTER` statements and their kin. The planner's ordering is the reason the diff keeps its structure.

The planner sequences operations by how nodes depend on one another: a role exists before the policy that names it, a table before the policies attached to it. It folds a paired drop-and-create of one logical object into a single rename. It lets a change to a parent stand in for changes to its children.

Each of those is a relationship between nodes. The walk keeps those relationships in its output — every issue carries its path, and the nodes it hands back are the IR nodes with their references intact — so the planner reads each one straight from the diff.

## Responsibilities

- **The framework** owns the walk, the pairing, the `missing | extra | mismatch` vocabulary, and the path. It names no node type.
- **A node** implements `id()`, `nodeKind()`, `isEqualTo()`, and `children()` in the package that defines it. A target-only node — an RLS policy, a role — implements them in the target package, the one place its type is named.
- **A derivation** builds one side's IR, populating every node that side carries in canonical form, so `isEqualTo` is a plain structural comparison rather than a normalizing one. A target's two derivations live with the target, written directly — not registered through a shared surface.

For a **content-addressed** node — an RLS policy — `id()` settles equality on its own: the wire name encodes the body, so two policies that pair by id are equal by construction. `isEqualTo` carries the nodes whose id does not capture their whole content.

## The table as a diffed node

The diff tree for RLS policies has three levels:

```
PostgresSchemaIR        (database root)  id() = pgSchemaName
  └─ PostgresTableNode  (table)          id() = "<schema>/<table>"
       └─ PostgresRlsPolicy (policy)     id() = wire name
```

`PostgresTableNode` groups the policies for one table. The table and root nodes both have `isEqualTo => true` because the RLS strategy diffs only policy content, not table structure. Their `missing`/`extra` issues are dropped by the caller's whitelist after the diff. The policy's `id()` is the bare wire name — it is unique within a table.

Relational table attributes (columns, indexes, constraints) are not yet diffed through this tree. Table nodes are groupers only for now; that is a separate change.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Adding a node type to the differ is local: implement the three methods on the node and have the derivations populate it. The framework does not change.
- The walk handles a tree of any depth, so a nested node — a column within a table — needs no change to the differ.
- Policies on two tables with the same wire name (same prefix + identical body → same hash) no longer collide: each sits in a distinct table node with a distinct path.

### Negative

- A comparison of flat, independent entities would need neither a recursive walk nor a child interface; the differ carries both so that nested and dependent nodes cost nothing at its core.

## Alternatives considered

**Flatten both IRs to a node list, then diff the lists.** Collect every node from each IR into one flat list per side and pair the lists. Simple to write, and enough when the entities compared are flat and independent. Rejected because the input then has no structure at all: the planner's ordering, rename-coalescing, and parent-stands-for-child reasoning each need a relationship between nodes, and a flat diff would force every one of them to rebuild relationships the diff had thrown away.

**Diff a derived IR against a raw contract.** Build only the introspected side into a schema IR and compare it against the contract object directly. Rejected because the two are different shapes, so the comparison must special-case which side is which — and a command that has no live database to introspect, such as generating a migration offline, then has no IR on that side at all, and that node type is absent from that command entirely. Deriving both sides to one shape makes every command uniform.

**Register the derivations through a generic contribution surface.** Add a registry where a target contributes a node type's project-from-contract and project-from-database pair, dispatched generically. Rejected as scope: a registration surface designed around a single node type on a single target is designed against one example, which is guesswork. A target writes its derivations directly until a second consumer makes the shared shape concrete.

**Port every node type onto the differ at once.** Move the relational node types — tables, columns, indexes, constraints — onto the walk in the same step that establishes it. Rejected as scope: each relational node type carries non-structural equality (type aliases, default normalization) and cross-sibling synthesis that are work in their own right. The walk handles a tree of any depth already, so which node types populate the tree can grow on its own schedule.

**Key nodes on `EntityCoordinate`.** Use the four-part `{plane, namespaceId, entityKind, entityName}` struct as the sibling key. Rejected because not all nodes are entities — a column has no `EntityCoordinate` — and it created a real bug: `PostgresRlsPolicy.coord()` omitted the table, but policy wire names are only unique per-table, so two tables with the same policy (same prefix + same body → same wire name) collided and the duplicate-key throw falsely rejected a valid contract. Path-based ids fix this by design: a node's identity within the differ is its position in the tree (the accumulated path), not a coordinate reconstructed from a struct.

**Fold a node's kind into its `id()` string.** Have a node whose name could collide with a differently-typed sibling (a role named `public` colliding with a namespace named `public`) prefix a sigil onto its `id()` so the two can never collide in the flat sibling map. Rejected: it leaks a differ-internal collision-avoidance detail into `id()`, which is also the value stamped into every emitted issue's `path` — so the sigil leaks into paths and needs laundering wherever a path is turned into a message. The differ now carries the discriminant itself: `nodeKind()` joins `id()` to key siblings, so `id()` needs only be unique among siblings of the same kind, and a node never encodes its kind into its id string.

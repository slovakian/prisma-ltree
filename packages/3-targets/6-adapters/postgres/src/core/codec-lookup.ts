 * Build a {@link CodecRegistry} populated with the Postgres-builtin codec definitions only.
 *
 * This is the default registry used by `createPostgresAdapter()` and `new PostgresControlAdapter()` when called without a stack-derived registry (e.g. from tests, or one-off scripts that don't compose a full stack).
 *
 * Extension codecs (e.g. `pg/vector@1` from `@prisma-next/extension-pgvector`) are intentionally NOT included here: a bare adapter cannot see extensions. Stack-composed paths (`SqlControlAdapterDescriptor.create(stack)` / `SqlRuntimeAdapterDescriptor.create(stack)`) supply the broader, extension-inclusive registry at construction time.

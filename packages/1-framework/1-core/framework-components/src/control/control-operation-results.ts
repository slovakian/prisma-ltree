/**
 * The three ways an actual state can fail an expectation: it contains a node
 * that was not expected, lacks a node that was expected, or holds a node that
 * is not equal to the expected one. Expected is the desired side and actual the
 * current side of whatever comparison produced the issue — contract-vs-database,
 * or contract-vs-contract in an offline plan — so the vocabulary is
 * comparison-relative and never ambiguous about a base.
 *
 * The failure reason is a structural characteristic carried as a declared
 * field: consumers filter on `reason`, never by enumerating kind strings or
 * family-invented node codes.

/**
 * The issue-based schema-verify result. `ok` derives from the FAILURE list
 * only: a verify passes exactly when `schema.issues` is empty, post
 * strict-gating and control-policy disposition.
 *
 * `schema.warnings` carries warn-graded issues (an `observed`-policy
 * subject's drift, and any other `warn` disposition) in the same shape.
 * Warnings are informational — they never affect `ok` — but they MUST be
 * surfaced: an `observed` table that drifted yields `ok: true` with a
 * non-empty warnings channel, which is what distinguishes "watch without
 * failing" from full suppression.

<!--
TML-2787 (M:N slice 3): namespace-scoped execution-default refs land in
`@prisma-next/sql-orm-client` (nested writes through a junction, the
required-payload gate, and the namespace-keyed `ExecutionMutationDefault.ref`).
The changes are internal to the ORM client and its emitted-contract consumption;
the extension-author surface is unchanged. No extension-author action — re-emit
picks up the new contract ref shape. Incidental substrate diff only.

TML-2929 (replace legacy PSL parser with CST symbol table): the SQL/Mongo PSL
interpreters now consume a symbol table built from the CST parser instead of the
legacy `parsePslDocument` AST. The only `packages/3-extensions/` touch is a
test-file call-shape rewire in `postgres/test/psl-namespace-qualifier-routing.test.ts`
(`{ document }` → the symbol-table interpreter input); no extension-author API
changed. No extension-author action. Incidental substrate diff only.
